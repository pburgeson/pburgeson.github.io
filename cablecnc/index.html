<div class="overview">
	<h1>Cable CNC</h1>
	<p>Creating a 2 axis CNC machine that utilizes a cable system instead of standard linear axes.  The basis of this idea is the <a href="https://www.maslowcnc.com/">Maslow CNC</a>  The intent is to make a 2 axis machine cablable of at least plywood CNC'ing and CNC plasma cutting of sheet metal.  The motors will be on the carriage to put all of the complexity into a single location and to allow for futuring scaling into a 3 axis cable CNC for use in a garden.</p>
