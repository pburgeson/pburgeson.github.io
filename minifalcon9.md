# Mini Falcon 9
A project to take off and propulsively land a model scale rocket similar to the SpaceX Falcon 9

## Background
I have always been amazed the engineering feat that SpaceX accomplishes each time they launch a Falcon 9 rocket and land it on a barge in the ocean.  I make a point to watch pretty much every single launch they stream.  I recently came across [Joe Barnard with BPS Space]("https://bps.space/") and his project to land a model rocket.  It inspired me to try it myself.  Being a novice at model rocketry, I have much to learn.

## Project Requirements
- Launch height of greater 100 m
- Thrust Vector Control on engine
- Throttlable rocket engine
- Airframe size of 34 mm OD
- Successful recovery of functional rocket
- Land vertically (ala Falcon 9)

## Project Process
The scope of this project is large enough, I will work my way up in complexity of the project.  Project will be divided into these steps.
* Build and fly custom model rocket
* Add data logging and telemetry on model rocket
* Implement thrust vector control on model rocket
* Create and test model rocket scale liquid rocket engine
* Implement liquid rocket engine on model rocket
* Land model rocket
