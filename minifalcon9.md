# Mini Falcon 9
A project to take off and propulsively land a model scale rocket similar to the SpaceX Falcon 9

## Background
I have always been amazed the engineering feat that SpaceX accomplishes each time they launch a Falcon 9 rocket and land it on a barge in the ocean.  I make a point to watch pretty much every single launch they stream.  I recently came across [Joe Barnard with BPS Space]("https://bps.space/") and his project to land a model rocket.  It inspired me to try it myself.  Being a novice at model rocketry, I have much to learn.

## Requirements
- Launch height of greater 100 m
- Thrust Vector Control on engine
- Throttlable rocket engine
- Airframe size of 34 mm OD

## Sub Projects
The scope of this project is large enough, I will split the project into two projects.  The first is to build and implement a thrust vector control system for a model rocket.  This will initially use standard powder engines.  The second would be development of the throttle-able rocket engine capable of the thrust needed.  Then the throttle-able rocket engine will be put in the model rocket
