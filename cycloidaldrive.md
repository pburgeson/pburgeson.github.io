# Cycloidal Drive
A (hopefully) short project to create a 3D printed cycloidal drive for an electric go kart.

## Background
In 2019, I acquired the go kart my wife used as kid.  It had a 10 hp engine and substial top speed.  Far too powerful for my young son.  I used an old <a href="https://www.teknic.com/model-info/CPM-MCVC-3432P-RLS/">teknic servo motor</a> and converted it to an electric go kart.  The servo motor doesn't have the torque to push my son up any grade or through the grass.  I'd like to design a cycloidal gearbox to increase the torque.  I may find that 3D printed parts don't cut it, but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.</p>

## Requirements
- Fits inline and no larger than NEMA 34 mountings
- 3D printed construction with purchased hardware and minimal machined components
- 20:1 gear reduction
- Design scalable down to 10:1 gear reduction
- 2 cycloidal discs to reduce vibration
