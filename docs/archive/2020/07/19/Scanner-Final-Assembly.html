    <p>The electronics PCB arrived from Germany this weekend.  There were months of delays due to COVID.  It was time to cease putting off additional progress.  I assembled the PCB which was a quick process as all components were through hole.  I took the risk of not testing more than a visual inspection of the soldered joints.  The components I was connecting were cheap and I have spares so I opted to just turn on power and see if anything was damaged.  After power was connected, nothing let out blue smoke so I forged ahead.</p>

<p>I’ve decided to change the requirements for the project and use the standard A4988 stepper drivers instead of the Trinamic drivers.  This is a direct effort to complete the project and not let the stepper drivers stand in my way.  As a seperate project, I want to build a A4988 to Trinamic adapter board as their footprints are not the same.  A couple of pins are switched.  I’ll probably just do a simple adapter board.  This will likely require some minor changes to the setup with A4988 either in software or hardware to ensure the microstepping is the same.  Perahps I should opt for some sort of logic circuit to do the microstepping conversion for me.  That might be a sellable product for people that want to upgrade the drivers on their 3D printers.</p>

<p>Finally, I installed the scanner on a piece of wood to keep in stationary during use.  This provides enough ballast that it won’t tip during scanning.  I may need to do some cable management on the system.  I’m going to see how well this functions for the time being.  Just putting the wiring in loom would make a big difference to the appearance of the system.</p>

<p>I captured a quick timelapse of the system mechanically functioning.  It operates slowly so a timelapse is the only reasonable way to watch it.  This video is doing what would be a scan of a golf ball.  I have not yet set up the bluetooth shutter so I haven’t attempted any scans.  I am quite close and getting steadily more excited.  I have not looked into the lighting or if this scan cycle is the right one for this particular scan.  I’m sure more will be learned as time goes on.</p>
