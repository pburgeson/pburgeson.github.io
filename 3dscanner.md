# 3D Scanner
Build and testing of 3D scanner from Open Scan [https://en.openscan.eu/](https://en.openscan.eu/). This is just using their plans and documents to successfully build a 3d scanner that uses photogrammetry. My primary intent is to not have to measure objects	that I want to design around in CAD. Typically that means I'll be 3D printing the parts that make with it so precision is not incredibly critical. If I can get with +/- 0.010 in, I'll be pretty happy.  

A secondary goal is to develop processes and methods for updating Github with project info and something akin to a project log.

# High Level Requirements
- Able to generate 3D data that Autodesk Fusion 360 is capable of working with
- Precision of 0.010" or better
- Scan Volume - Cylinder of 12 in diameter and height of 8 in
- <s>Use of Trinamic stepper drivers*</s>
*Removed as openscan pcb was not compatible with Trinamic Step Stick and does not affect functionality
