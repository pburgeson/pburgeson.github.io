	<h1>Hi.</h1>
	<h2>I'm Paul.</h2>
	<p>
		I'm an engineer and I love building things.  Going through the process of understanding a problem, concepting ideas, 
		interating designs, and finally creating an end result is thrilling.  There are few things more satisfying than finally 
		hitting on that simple, elegant solution after hours of thought.  
	</p>
		I love learning new things.  The preferred approach is dive in and try it.  Different endeavours significantly afield my
		schooling have included CNC machining, glass making, flying, artificial intelligence, and mindfulness.  Learning by working through real problems
		has proven to be far more valuable than just reading about concepts.  It is incredibly exciting when concepts that were 
		in books are demostrated in the real world with a clear understanding of what is at play.
