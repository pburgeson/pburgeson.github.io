The handheld version of this gearbox was 3D printed after addition of some rather generous space to all the mating surfaces.  The extra room was given as I haven't characterized my 3D printer's tolerances.  I wanted to validate the motion and opted to accept significant slop in the gear train.  This example is the size I'm expecting the final gearbox to be and it seems to fit inside the NEMA 34 envelope.  I'm concerned about the space that is available for all the bearings that are needed.  I may have to have bearing on 3D printed componenets.  We shall how the design shakes out.
