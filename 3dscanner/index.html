<div class="overview">
	<h1>3D Scanner</h1>
	<p>Build and testing of 3D scanner from Open Scan (https://en.openscan.eu/). This is just using their plans and documents 
		to successfully build a 3d scanner that uses photogrammetry. My primary intent is to not have to measure objects 
		that I want to design around in CAD. Typically that means I'll be 3D printing the parts that make with it so
		precision is not incredibly critcal. If I can get with +/- 0.010 in, I'll be pretty happy. </p>
	<p>A secondary goal is to develop processes and methods for updating github with project info and something akin to a project log.</p>
