title: "Stepper Driver Testing"

It's been many years since I drove a stepper motor from an arduino.  In order to get back into the saddle, I made a simple arduino sketch for making a motor rotate.  The goal is to simply have the arduino get a stepper motor to drive using the step and direction pins on a silent step stick with a TMC2208 from trinamic on it.  The trinamic stepper motor drives are a project requirement.

The sketch can be found on my github **here**.  A quick video showing the testing results is below.
