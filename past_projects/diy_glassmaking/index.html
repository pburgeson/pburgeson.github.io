<h1>DIY Glassmaking</h1>
<p>A short project intended to create glass starting with only sand.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>My wife and I fell in love during a trip to St George Island, FL.  In an effort to commemorate that trip, I decided to try to make jewelry from the sand at the beach.  I discretely gathered some sand from the beach on a later trip.  My intent was to make glass with it and then give the glass to jewelry maker to cut the glass into stones similar in appearance to diamonds.</p>

<h2>Research & Equipment</h2>
<p>A lot of my confidence in attempting this project came from Applied Scince's video on making photochromatic glass.</p>
